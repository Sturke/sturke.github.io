I finally got deployed to gh-pages branch. [Sean Coughlin's Blog](https://blog.seancoughlin.me/publishing-a-sveltekit-app-to-github-pages) was instrumental in helping me understand and get this done. The only thing that got jammed up was the part in his page where he added vitePreprocess. That threw all kinds of errors. I removed it and it works. I also used his advise on his post [Deploying to GitHub Pages using gh-pages](https://blog.seancoughlin.me/deploying-to-github-pages-using-gh-pages).

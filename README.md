I began learning how to write HTML in 1996. I bought a book and taught myself how to build a website. I still didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge yet. I was running a landscaping business at the time and didn't devote a lot of time to HTML. It was more of a late night hobby. Later in 2010, I went to college and got my AAS in Graphic Design and took many web design and web development classes as well as one intro to javascript programming class. I graduated in 2014 with honors. Unfortunately, I have not been working in the field and the although the process is still fundamentally the same, the tools and popular languages have moved forward and now I am playing catch up. Some things look like they have improved significantly for the better. Other improvements in the technology are escaping my grasp for now. 

2020 and 2021 have been a challenge with the Covid-19 pandemic and political circus surrounding it. I want to work from home and this pandemic is my motivation to finally enter this field, stay safe from the pandemic, and to explore and expand my mind, talents, abilities, and skills. 

In November of 2022, I reached out to see if our local meet-up for Free Code Camp was active. We've been meeting most weeks since then. I have learned a lot. Each week is kind of like drinking from a firehose. One of the guys is really excited about Svelte. I'm going to practice using Svelte to rebuild this page.

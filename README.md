I'm working to learn, learning to improve and I am working and learning to build a career that I can take into retirement.

I have been out of touch with all of this HTML, CSS, JS and website building for quite some time. It's been a long road. I began learning how to write HTML in 1996. I bought a book and taught myself how to build a website. I still didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge yet. I was running a landscaping business at the time and didn't devote a lot of time to HTML. It was more of a late night hobby. Later in 2010, I went to college and got my AAS in Graphic Design and took many web design and web development classes as well as one intro to javascript programming class. I came away with a degree, but didn't feel confident that I was knowledgeable enough to be employed in the field. So, I took a job just to have an income. Here we are in 2021 and I'm still employed and not in my degree field. 

I really want to and I really need to get this figured out.

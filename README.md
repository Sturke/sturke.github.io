I began learning how to write HTML in 1996. I bought a book and taught myself how to build a website. I still didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge yet. I was running a landscaping business at the time and didn't devote a lot of time to HTML. It was more of a late night hobby. Later in 2010, I went to college and got my AAS in Graphic Design and took many web design and web development classes as well as one intro to javascript programming class. I graduated in 2014 with honors. Unfortunately, I have not been working in the field and the although the process is still fundamentally the same, the tools and popular languages have moved forward and now I am playing catch up. Some things look like they have improved significantly for the better. Other improvements in the technology are escaping my grasp for now. 

2020 and 2021 have been a challenge with the Covid-19 pandemic and political circus surrounding it. I want to work from home and this pandemic is my motivation to finally enter this field, stay safe from the pandemic, and to explore and expand my mind, talents, abilities, and skills. 

In November of 2022, I reached out to see if our local meet-up for Free Code Camp was active. We've been meeting most weeks since then. I have learned a lot. Each week is kind of like drinking from a firehose. One of the guys is really excited about Svelte. I'm going to practice using Svelte to rebuild this page.  


# Svelte Starter

[![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sponsor&message=%E2%9D%A4&logo=GitHub&color=%23fe8e86)](https://github.com/sponsors/shinokada)


This Svelte starter template provides a comprehensive foundation for developing with Svelte and Vite, including preconfigured support for TailwindCSS, Flowbite-Svelte, and Svelte-Spa-Router. Additionally, it includes a sample implementation of fetching data from a backend API, making it easy to integrate with your own server-side infrastructure.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shinokada/svelte-starter.git my-app
cd my-app
pnpm i
```

Update dependencites:

```sh
pnpm update
pnpm i flowbite-svelte@latest flowbite@latest
```
ERR 
So I ran:
```sh
npm update flowbite-svelte
```

## Backend API env value

Update your backend API value in `.env`:

```text
API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/api
API_SECRET=1234
```

## Start a local server

```bash
npm run dev
```
## Local Server is working! 09/27/2023
Now I just need to work on learning which files to modify to my needs.

## How to use this for GitHub page

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy your GitHub page to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository name>` URL. Donâ€™t forget to change the username and repository name to your personal Github username and repository.
It may take a couple of minutes. You can check the progress in GitHub Actions tab.
